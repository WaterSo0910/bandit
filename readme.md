## Background
In the latest research, we could found a better choice(Neural Network) for applying on recommendation system. However, its cost is too large so that it haven't been popular nowadays.

## Problem description
Let's take Netflix recommendation system as an example,  we consider 3 main conditions which may cause tremendous cost:
1. The number of users (T)
2. The size of parameters in NN (Theta)
3. The number of movies (Arm)
## Algorithm implementation
- NeuralUCB algorithm

## Contribution
We proposed 3 methods:
1. lazy update
2. ons
3. hash + inner product

## Result
- Total speed
